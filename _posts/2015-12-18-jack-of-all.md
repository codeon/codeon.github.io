In Jan 2015, I joined qplum as a full stack engineer. Like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, "Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.", I have got innumerable opportunities to learn and apply since then. From hardening web server security to building background job processing architectures to writing responsive web views, I have had a chance to do them all.

But what does it mean to learn all this, if I couldn't master anything. Did I just become a jack of all trades?

I have pondered over the same question a lot, but somewhere there is a latent presumption that being a jack is not useful. However, I believe that with such diversity in tasks I needed to learn about how different components interact, the possibilities of the actions I take and the outcomes of my decisions. Having this experience has helped me develop intuition which comes in incredibly handy while discussing new service/feature architectures.

Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy for Cognitive Domain defines the six categories of all cognitive processes as :

What I love about my role is that it helps me develop all the six cognitive processes. Add to that, the satisfaction of building a product end-to-end where I have complete ownership and responsibility. Being in such a position helps me think in ways that I haven’t before. It can evoke attention to detail, and in some ways an obsession with the product.

But for all this to happen, I need freedom and confidence from my company so that I can try out new things, succeed in some and fail in most. I am lucky to be a part of such a company which enables me to learn, to experiment, to implement.

Even as a team culture , we maintain this learning environment, where everyone has a primary responsibility but are still free to choose tasks they want to learn about and work on. It has been very successful as more people are familiar with how things work in tandem, and how changing a component affects its dependencies. In parallel, our primary responsibilities determine our areas of expertise and help us become “Jack of all trades and master of some”.
